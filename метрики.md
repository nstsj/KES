**метрики для IR/IE:**

оффлайн-метрики

1. Precision - точность (how many selected are relevant)
	* Rank-based precision (RBP) -  - for ranked docs 
	* Average precision
	* Mean average Precision (MAP) - for ranked docs
	* Precision at some cutoff (Precision@k) where K is a number of retrieved docs (least stable as depends on K)
	* R-Precision where R is a number of all relevant documents (requires having a set of known relevant documents, from which we calculate the precision of the top rel documents returned.  Describes only one point on the precision-recall curve)


2. Recall - полнота (how mane relevant are selected)

3. F1 = The Dice coefficient 

4. P,R,F1 Хорошевского

5. Fall-out: The proportion of non-relevant documents that are retrieved, out of all non-relevant documents available:  = (1-Recall)

6. discounted cumulative gain (DCG)
	* Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) - designed for situations of non-binary notions of relevance 

7. Mean reciprocal rank

8. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
9. bpref - a summation-based measure of how many relevant documents are ranked before irrelevant documents[9]
10. GMAP - geometric mean of (per-topic) average precision[9]
11. Measures based on marginal relevance and document diversity - see Relevance (information retrieval)
12. Measures of both relevance and credibility (for fake news in search results
13. ROC curve (corresponding to the precision-recall curve. An ROC curve always goes from the bottom left to the top right of the graph.  a common aggregate measure is to report the area under the ROC curve, which is the ROC analog of MAP)
14. Bayesian metrics

1. **Session abandonment rate** is a ratio of search sessions which do not result in a click.

2. **Click-through rate** (CTR) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.[1]

3. **Session success rate** measures the ratio of user sessions that lead to a success. Defining "success" is often dependent on context, but for search a successful result is often measured using dwell time as a primary factor along with secondary user interaction, for instance, the user copying the result URL is considered a successful result, as is copy/pasting from the snippet.

4. **Zero result rate** (ZRR) is the ratio of SERPs which returned with zero results. The metric either indicates a recall issue, or that the information being searched for is not in the index.

7. EBU (Expected Browsing Utility)
